# Installation

`python -m venv ./.venv`

`source .venv/bin/activate`

`pip install --upgrade wheel`

Had to run `brew install portaudio` on mac before pip installing worked.
Probably on Pi it'll be `sudo apt install portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio`.

`brew install flac`

To install python deps:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
